## Weekly Meetings and feedback
WEEK 1
Today, the class was introduced to our client, Erion who is an artist living in Greece and after the meeting, we did the group formation. Mathew Marvel, Mileva Mariyana, Izekor Kingsley, Vanesa Taneva, Martin Alashki, and Donald Umoru make up our group of six. We have chosen to name our group 'Alpha', a Greek term that denotes strength and dominance.
We also talked about the project rules among us, and Mariyana was given the responsibility of writing the project rules. We have all agreed to work during the week, adhere to deadlines, and treat others with respect. Our collective goal is to make our workspace pleasant and comfortable.
Later in the day, we had to come up with a main question which we will in turn break down into sub/research questions. We got feedback from Metaxas after coming up with the main question and from the feedback, we understand that our main question needs to be structured in a way that it fully covers the problem that the client is trying to solve.


WEEK 2
Following the feedback last week, we have worked harder to correctly restructure our main question and divide it down into sub questions that, when answered, provide an answer to the main question.  Also, we have begun work on the project plan and have learned about the CMD METHODS PACK, a deck of cards created to assist with design research planning in any CMD project. The DOT Framework's CMD technique provides a more accommodating solution for design research planning.
We have decided to use 14 cards from the set to conduct our research after carefully reviewing our research questions.
We showed our progress so far with our research plan to Metaxas and what we understand from the feedback is that the choice of 14 cards is doable.
We also have a new group member, Dang Khoa.
To continue working on it, we have evenly divided up the project project plan into sections. We will continue working on it and will finish before next Thursday when we have to present the project plan and group rules at the end of the first sprint.


WEEK 3
Today we are working on completing the first version of our project plan and also preparing a presentation of the project plan later in the afternoon.
From the feedback from Metaxas, we understand that we should:

1.	Ensure to add short descriptions in sections where any information is illustrated using a table or a figure as this helps the reader understand better.

2.	We should explain in section 2, the research approach that we are using and also explain the reason for the research activities that are assigned to each research question. This clarifies to the reader our reasons for wanting to find out specific information and how we intend to get the answers for these questions.

Following the feedback, we will continue to work on the project plan to implement the necessary changes. 

WEEK 4
Following the group presentation last week, we are continuing our work this week by finalizing our project plan and developing our interview questions. Vanesa emailed our client to inquire about the likelihood of scheduling an interview in the coming weeks.
As part of the project, we have also begun working on a template document from the UCD class.
Our mission statement, project details, and user and functional requirements are all included in the project template. Once more, we have divided the work among the team members, and each one is solely accountable for documenting the task that has been allocated to him, not for completing it alone. Next week, we will meet again to discuss and agree on the interview questions.


WEEK 5
This week, we continued work on our project template and also, in preparation for our upcoming interview, we have been working gathering and documenting interview questions. In order to design a website that truly captures their style and accomplishes his objectives, we want to make sure we collect all the information required.
After gathering the interview questions, on Tuesday, we showed the first version to Amer and from his feedback, we understand that the questions are good and he pointed out some questions that are not neccessary.

On Thursday, we showed the second version to Metaxas and from the feedback we understand again that the questions are good. Also, he pointed out:

1.	Some questions that need to be rephrased
2.	The client Erion did mention that he used to have a website.
3.	To rethink the question about the logo as an artist does not neccessarily need to have a logo and try to deal with it a bit more abstract.
4.	To rephrase the Yes/No questions to be able to get more information from Erion.
5.	Having an interview with a curator would give us more insight and also to conduct more interviews instead of sticking to just the survey as interviews would give us more insight.

We successfully scheduled the interview with Erion for Monday 20-03-2023 at 15:00.

Following the interview, we will create a survey to help us learn more about user needs. The data gathered would help in our understanding of the target audience. To conduct this survey, we plan to take a group trip to different museums to ensure the results we get from the survey are efficient and very relevant in the development of the website.

WEEK 6
On Monday 20-03-2023 at 15:00, we conducted our interview with Erion. After that, we transcribed the interview and reviewed the notes and also held a team meeting on Thursday to discuss the next steps for the project. 
We have planned a survey and after developing the survey questions, we received feedback from Amer and from the feedback we understand that it would be better to also have questions for people who dont visit art websites as we could also gain more insight from them as well.
Next week, we plan to take a group trip to visit different museums in Amsterdam where we can conduct the survey with people who are actually interested in art.


WEEK 7
This week, our team made significant progress on the website project for our client. We took a trip to Amsterdam to the Van Gogh museum and Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam to conduct surveys. We also created an online version on google forms and we sent out the link to people. 
Our main reason for conducting the survey is to understand the target audience's preferences and expectations regarding the website's design, functionality, and content. We learned a lot about the requirements and preferences of the users from the responses we received.
We have started creating two personas and user scenarios based on the survey answers to depict the various user types who might access the website. By using these personas, we can understand better our visitors' demands when designing the website.

Next Steps:
Next week, we plan to focus on the following tasks:
* Finish creating the personas and user scenarios putting the feedback received from Metaxas into consideration.

We made good progress this week overall, and we're on track to deliver a website that fulfills the requirements and expectations of our client. We are eager to carry out more work on this project and develop a website that properly displays the client's artistic abilities.


WEEK 8
This week the team has completed the personas and user scenario creation based on our findings from the user research.
We presented our findings and progress so far to the class and after the presentation, we received feedback from Metaxas and from the feedback we understand that the work we did for the research is good but we should ensure to make our message clearer by using less texts in the presentation slides and explaining more verbally.
Following this feedback, we will work more on improving to deliver much better presentations in the future.

The team plans to contact the client next week to discuss the findings from our user research.
We team will also work on creating a video for one of the scenarios for an assignment for the UCD class.

WEEK9
This week we have been working on the user research report and on Thursday we presented the report to Metaxas and received feedback on how to improve the document before submitting for easier understanding. From the feeback, we understand that overall our current version is good but it could be improved to provide better understanding for the reader and we can make this improvement by:

1.	Include the things said by the client during the interview to make the document believable.
2.	Connect the things said by the client with our research questions.
3.	Include more details to the bullet points in parenthesis to give accountability.
4.	Add and refer to the interview transcript for more context.
5.	Add a brief introduction before stating the functional and user requirements.
6.	Include a brief description about the interview and how it was conducted just like we did with the user survey.
7.	State clearly in the beginning what we plan to accomplish with the document.

Following this feedback, we will implement these changes to improve and complete this document and commit to GIT.
Next, we are going to start with individual sketching, prototyping of the website then we will meet to discuss design ideas, ask and feedback and agree on what prototype to move forward with. 

WEEK 10:
During this week, the team worked on various aspects of the project. Firstly, we created a scenario video to showcase one of the user personas, Bianca, and her journey through the website. The video aimed to provide a visual representation of how users would interact with the website and help the team gather feedback from the UCD class. At the end, we presented the video to the entire class.

Additionally, the team continued working on the user research report, incorporating feedback received from Metaxas. The report aimed to document the findings from the initial user research phase, including user interviews, surveys, and observations. The team analyzed the collected data to gain a deeper understanding of the target users' needs, preferences, and pain points. The feedback from Metaxas ensured that the user research report was comprehensive and accurately represented the research findings.

Furthermore, during week 10, each member of the group began working on creating individual prototypes for the website. These prototypes served as initial design concepts that showcased different ideas and approaches to the website's layout, navigation, and visual elements. By creating individual prototypes, the team explored various design possibilities, fostering creativity and collaboration within the group.

WEEK 11:
In week 11, the team came together to evaluate and select one prototype from the individual designs. We conducted a review and comparison of the individual prototypes, considering factors such as user-friendliness, aesthetics, and alignment with the project's goals and target audience. Through collaborative discussions and deliberations, the team reached a consensus on the most promising prototype that would serve as the foundation for the group prototype.

Once the prototype was chosen, the team started working on the group prototype collectively. We collaborated closely to refine the design, make necessary adjustments based on the data from the user research phase, and ensure a cohesive and consistent user experience throughout the website. The team made design decisions collaboratively, incorporating valuable insights from the user research findings to create a user-centered and visually appealing website.

WEEK 12:
During week 12, the team focused on making further iterations to the group prototype, aiming to deliver a website that meets the needs and expectations of the target users. We created a new Figma document, providing a centralized space where everyone could contribute their design ideas and suggestions for the prototype. This collaborative approach allowed the team to leverage each member's expertise and creativity, fostering a sense of shared ownership and ensuring a comprehensive and well-rounded design.

By iterating on the group prototype, the team refined the website's layout, user interface, and interactions, taking into account the feedback received from user research activities and incorporating best practices in web design. We aimed to create a visually engaging and intuitive website that effectively communicates the artist's brand and portfolio while catering to the preferences and expectations of the target audience.

Throughout week 12, the team focused on continuous improvement, actively seeking feedback from both peers and teachers. This iterative process helped us refine ur design choices, identify areas for enhancement, and align their prototype with the project's objectives and user needs.

Week 13:
During this week, the team started working on conducting user research activities to gather valuable insights on improving our prototype. We created and sent out surveys to collect quantitative data on user preferences, expectations, and usability of the website. Simultaneously, interviews were conducted to delve deeper into the users' needs, motivations, and pain points. The information gathered from these research activities provided valuable inputs for refining the design and functionality of the website.

What's next:
Moving forward, the team plans to analyze and synthesize the research findings gathered during this phase. They will carefully review the survey responses and interview transcripts, identifying common themes and patterns in user preferences and behavior. This analysis will provide actionable insights to refine the design and enhance the user experience of the website.

WEEK 14:
Building upon the data collected in the previous weeks, the team focused on analyzing the research findings and translating them into actionable insights. We synthesized the survey responses and interview transcripts, gaining a deeper understanding of the target users' needs, preferences, and pain points.

Based on these insights, the team identified specific design and functionality improvements for the group prototype. We refined the user personas, ensuring that the website design aligns with the needs and expectations of the identified user groups. The goal was to create a user-centric website that offers an engaging and intuitive experience for both existing and potential visitors.

The team also created storyboards to visualize and illustrate the user journey through the website. Storyboards helped identify potential usability issues, highlight key interactions, and ensure a seamless user experience. By mapping out the user flow and interactions, the team could identify areas of improvement and make informed design decisions for the website.

The team also began working on the project's technical report, a comprehensive documentation of the project process. The report will capture the project's objectives, methodologies, research findings, design decisions, and implementation details.

What's next:
Moving forward, in the next few weeks, the team will finalize the technical report, ensuring all sections are included and the content accurately represents the project. We will review and revise the report based on feedback, maintaining consistency in writing style and formatting. As the project progresses, the team will update the report to reflect any changes or challenges encountered during implementation.


WEEK 15:
In week 15, we held a meeting and interview with the client during this week. This interaction allowed us to present our progress, receive valuable feedback, and align our design decisions with the client's vision and expectations. This client engagement was crucial in ensuring that the project remained on track and that the website aligned with the artist's goals and brand identity.

Throughout the week, the team received feedback multiple times from Metaxas, who provided guidance and suggestions for improving the technical report. Incorporating this feedback helped refine the report's structure, content, and clarity, ensuring that it effectively communicates the project's goals, processes, and outcomes to stakeholders, including the client, instructors, and other relevant parties.

Next, the team plans to incorporate the feedback received from the client meeting and integrate it into the design and functionality of the website. We will iterate on the group prototype, implementing the necessary improvements based on the client's input, user research findings, and best practices in web design. The aim is to create a website that meets the client's expectations while effectively serving the needs of the target audience.

Simultaneously, the team initiated the coding phase of the project. This involved translating the design decisions into functional code, implementing the desired features and functionalities of the website. The coding process requires close collaboration and coordination among team members to ensure consistent code quality, efficient development, and adherence to project deadlines.

What's next:
Looking ahead, the team plans to continue the website development process by further refining the coding and implementing the desired functionalities. We will work collaboratively to ensure seamless integration of the design elements


## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.

## Authors and acknowledgment
Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.

## License
For open source projects, say how it is licensed.

## Project status
If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.
